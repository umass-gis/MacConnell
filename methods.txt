Details of the methods:

- Phtomosaics uploaded. So far an excel sheet contains the corresponding area to code mapping.
- Becky digitized the flight path manually.
- Found the corresponding photomosaic to the original MacConnel image. Need to crop out the required portion from the photomosaic and then perform geo-referencing.
- ArcGIS need to be explored.
- AutoGR could be explored for more functionalities.
